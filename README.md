Proposed Meeting schedule (must meet at least once a week outside of class throughout the semester, but can be more as needed -- meetings can be in person or remote over Zoom or MS Teams.  Note that talking together for 5 minutes in the classroom before class starts is not a "meeting", but an organized sit-down meeting immediately before or after class time is fine.)
Project Launch Meeting
Wednesday · 7:00 – 7:45pm

Sprint 4: Stuart
Programming Language your team will use for project (note that anything other than C#, C++, Java, or Python will need instructor permission)
Language of Choice: Python
Source Control (what your team will use for a central repository for code or other project files -- GitHub, Visual Studio Version Control, or something similar.  I would recommend using something that has version control, not just a cloud storage folder).
GitHub
Project Management -- what your team will use for task management, to-do lists, and other project specific details (may be the same as the source control option).  
Linear
